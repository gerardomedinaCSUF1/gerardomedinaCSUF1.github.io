I am a computer science major at Cal State Fullerton and I plan to graduate in 2027.

## Favorite labs 

Lab 5 part 1
I enjoyed the first part of lab 5 regarding the area of a rectangle since it allowed me to practice using a math formula while coding.
Another topic I enjoyed about the lab was the use of multiple arguments in a line to make coding simpler. The use of multiple arguments
when calculating the area of a rectangle allowed me to do more in less lines of code.

Lab 6 Part 1
The other lab regarding the problem of a sandwich allowed me to practice the .at index line. The vector that contained the sandwich as well as
the toppings allowed me to practice using a string inside a vector. I liked the ability to create a sandwich object with command line arguments.

Lab 8 Part 2
I enjoyed part 2 of lab 8 since we had to draw a picture of dashes using a while loop as well as the use of a counter. I liked using the counter
to create the rows and columns for my picture. Using the counter allowed me to let the program create the picture without using more lines of code
for a simple object.
